         pyang now has a proper XPath 1.0 parser, which means that it will

           that for example refer to unknown nodes
         for python coders: non backwards compatible change in the
           pyang.xpath module.  the function xpath.tokens() has been
           replaced by pyang.xpath_lexer.scan(), but it also return
           tokens in a new format
         for python coders: non backwards compatible change in
           statements.add_xpath_function().  this function now takes
           three parameters, instead of just one
         pyang -f yang now keeps comments by default.  use
           the parameter --yang-remove-comments to remove them

           the generic guidelines defined in RFC 6087.  the 'ietf' plugin
