Install
-------
In this directory run:

  python setup.py install

(this might require root access)


To install in a different location, run:

  python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local

If you do this, it is recommended to set the environment variable
YANG_INSTALL to the prefix directory.  This ensures that pyang will
find standard YANG modules. In addition, make sure that PYTHONPATH is set
to something as follows:

export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages

or whatever version of python you are running.


Run locally without installing
------------------------------
export PATH=`pwd`/bin:$PATH
export MANPATH=`pwd`/man:$MANPATH
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH
export YANG_MODPATH=`pwd`/modules:$YANG_MODPATH
export PYANG_XSLT_DIR=`pwd`/xslt
export PYANG_RNG_LIBDIR=`pwd`/schema

or:

source ./env.sh


Usage
-----
pyang -h
man pyang

  Executable scripts.

pyang/
  Contains the pyang library code.

pyang/__init__.py
  Initialization code for the pyang library.
  Defines the Context and Repository classes.

pyang/syntax.py
  Generic syntax checking for YANG and YIN statements.
  Defines regular expressions for argument checking of core
  statements.

pyang/grammar.py
  Generic grammar for YANG and YIN.
  Defines chk_module_statements() which validates a parse tree
  according to the grammar.

  DSRL schemas and validating instance documents. Also included is the
  free implementation of ISO Schematron by Rick Jelliffe from
  http://www.schematron.com/ (files iso_schematron_skeleton_for_xslt1.xsl,
  iso_abstract_expand.xsl and iso_svrl_for_xslt1.xsl).

schema
