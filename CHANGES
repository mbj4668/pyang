         removed the deprecated, incomplete and erroneous XSD plugin - use
           the DSDL plugin instead.
         added new plugin: 'lint' to check if a module follow
           the generic guidelines defined in RFC 6087.  the 'ietf' plugin
           still exists, but is rewritten to use the new 'lint' plugin.
         added new plugin: 'name' to print a module's name, thanks to
           Giles Heron.
         by default, pyang now scans the YANG module path recursively,
           i.e., it searches for YANG modules also in subdirectories to the
           directories in the load path.  this behavior can be disabled with
           --no-path-recurse.
         the directory 'modules' now has two subdirectories 'iana' and
           'ietf', where all current IANA and IETF modules are located.
         a bash completions file has been added etc/bash_completion.d
