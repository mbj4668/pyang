Install
-------
In this directory run:

  python setup.py install

(this might require root access)


To install in a different location, run:

  python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local

If you do this, it is recommended to set the environment variable
YANG_INSTALL to the prefix directory.  This ensures that pyang will
find standard YANG modules.


Usage
-----
pyang -h
man pyang

Run locally without installing
------------------------------

export PATH=`pwd`/bin:$PATH
export MANPATH=`pwd`/man:$MANPATH
export YANG_MODPATH=`pwd`/modules:$YANG_MODPATH
export PYANG_XSLT_DIR=$p/xslt
export PYANG_RNG_LIBDIR=$p/schema

pyang -h
